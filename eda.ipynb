My experience has been to be very persistent with  the doctors and don't let up on them for re-evaluation.  I've learned alot  with the boys, especially when they were very young and could not  communicate.  I was kust extremely persistent, because there is no need for  pain and  discomfort when, most  times, there is so combination of medicines  that will get the job done.    I was telling Momma I was cracking up when you were talking about your  \"breakthrough\" on the radio.  I told her, if only the audience knew what you  were talking about!  I still haven't had a chance to check into those houses in Virginina Beach  for our vacation, I called yesterday afternoon around 4:30 and they were  closed,I forgot about the time difference.

Graph 1 is site totals, graph  2 is (total lost)/(total actual production) where total actual production is  taken from the kWh reported in the owner report, and graph 3 is the by  turbine distribution (using box plots) of energy lost.   The energy lost estimation method I employed is susceptible to problems with  data recovery (10-minute data), which in May 2002 was especially poor at  Klondike and Fenner, so those number are not as informative as those for the  other sites.   If these graphs provide you the information you need, I will continue with  the remaining months (Jan - Apr). Otherwise let me know and we'll refine this  process to get you what you need.  Mark \n",

Though I don't know if he expected individual turbines to have more  impact on the site average than they do . For 10 turbines having one drop 5%  only lowers the site by .5%.

Both Texas sites had VERY high numbers of \"wind  deviation\" faults.  I am also attaching a file (from a different work request) that has a pareto  (by site) of the mean number of faults per turbine (may2002mean_faults.pdf),  which shows that the Texas sites have the highest mean faults per turbine.  This also has boxplots of the number of faults by site to show the outliers.  I will do the June data, if still desired, when the data upload is completed.

I was  hoping you could respond.    We routinely see citizens of a country hold an ""inferior"" currency despite  the presence of superior alternatives.  The incumbent currency has a smaller  bid/ask spread, and a network externality  locks-in  the inferior currency.   Volume creates lower spreads and lower spreads in turn attract more volume,  conferring a monopoly status on the incumbent currency.  Do you think that Enron Online is taking advantage of a similar network  externality?  How do our bid/ask spreads compare to the alternatives  available to our competitors?  Do we stand willing to match our competitors  bid/offer?  A final note:  I was curious to learn what you did to become so successful.   Is there a place where your biography or resume is posted?

E-Business Relationships can mean a lot of things.  At it's core, it is  understanding the needs of your customers, partners, and employees  (collectively, your Business Community), and getting the right content to the  right person to generate the greatest impact in the most timely and effective  manner possible.  Strong e-Relationships increase retention rates, conversion rates and drive  long term loyalty.  The idea is to make the internet your Business  Communities' preferred channel for completing a transaction that is being  offered, whether that is completing a support call, buying a product,  registering for an event or service, enabling partner success, managing an  account, training, or just acquiring information.  As Enron Corp looks ahead, it is important to continue to better understand  who your Business Community are and in turn build online relationships with  them.  Studies have shown that companies spend five times more on attracting  new customers than on retaining the customers they have.  Attracting new  employees can cost 10 times more than retaining existing employees, and in  the energy business your reputation with your partners is critical to your  success.  Vignette is the undisputed leader in Value Chain and eRelationship Management  with the most robust platform, applications and services offerings in the  industry.  With over 1200 customers, Vignette is helping our customers  create, manage and automate their online relationships.  The Vignette  Platform enables our customers to manage and automate the flow of information  from their back office to their front office, from their suppliers to their  customers, partners, and employees and all the way through eMarketplaces and  exchanges.  Some examples of value we deliver to our customers include:  - Portals - Reliant Energy, Shell Oil, Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE),  Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA), Fidelity, Merrill Lynch, C/Net,  ICQ, Industry Standard, iWon, United Airlines - Knowledge Management - Encyclopedia Britannica, AMA, NotHarvard, Click2Learn - Customer Self-service - 3Com, On Semiconductor, Bank One, Compaq, First  Union - eCommerce - FuelQuest, DownStream Energy, Land's End, Ingram Micro,  Travelocity - Partner Enablement - National Semiconductor, Compaq, AMD, NASD, Deutsche  Telecom - Online Learning - Epic Learning, Family Education Center, NotHarvard - Syndicated Business Network - National Semiconductor - Data Mining & Analysis- Amazon, Seagate - Back Office Integration & Partner Exchanges- ExxonMobil, Grainger,  AltaVista, Honda, Coca-Cola  I have included a case study done on Royal Dutch Shell that I think you will  find informative as well as relevant to your business.  Over the next few  weeks, you will receive a more detailed information packet from Vignette.  http://www.vignette.com/CDA/Site/0,2097,1-1-31-1665-1054-1374,00.html  I am part of a team that works with central region major accounts focusing on  energy companies.

Skilling  President and COO  Enron Corporation   Dear Mr. Skilling:   Building on the success of our special event held this past August in  Houston, Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) has created a new  service, the ""Mexico Energy Advisory Service"". Designed to help facilitate  the dialogue between the energy community and key government decision-makers,  this service creates an open environment for members to exchange ideas with  the country's energy policy makers regarding the future of the Mexican energy  sector and the role of private investment.  To launch this new service, we will be hosting the inaugural Mexico Energy  Summit on January 17, 2001 in Mexico City at the JW Marriott Hotel. This  event will bring together senior executives from the energy community as well  as key members of the new Mexican government in interactive sessions aimed at  facilitating dialogue between the public and private sectors.  We invite you to consider participating in this first Summit, and becoming a  member of the service. To view the agenda for the first Summit meeting, as  well as a description of the scope, benefits, and deliverables of the  service, please visit our website at:  http://www20.cera.com/event/details/0,1324,CID1287,00.html   The goal of the Mexico Energy Advisory Service is to help bridge the  information gap that now exists in Mexico's energy sector. Through our  interactions with the private sector, the state owned energy companies, the  new administration, the Congress, and other interested parties, CERA will  formulate objective and independent market analysis, and will monitor the  progress and pitfalls of the energy reform process in Mexico.  To view the complete details of the service, please visit our website at:  http://www20.cera.com/offerings/details/0,1504,CID1286,00.html   To participate in the Summit, please complete and return the enrollment form  found on our website.

The audience will be composed of senior government officials from IEA member countries who serve as delegates to three of our ""Standing Groups"" (i.e., oversight committees); the Standing Group on the Oil Market, the Standing Group on Emergency Questions and the Standing Group on the Long-Term. Chatham House rules will apply (no attribution without permission, no press, open exchange of ideas).  If your schedule and inclination permits, we would like you to speak for about 25-35 minutes on corporate objectives and strategies, your experiences to date and any general plans for the future (that you are permitted to discuss), with a focus on the gas and electric industries.  Case studies of particular business developments would be of special interest.  The presentation would be in the second panel of the morning on ""Sectoral Aspects of Energy M&A Activities from a Company Perspective"".  The 2-hour session would start  at around 11AM and would include two other speakers from Europe covering oil; Michel de Fabiani (President of BP France and chief architect of the BP-Mobl downstream joint venture), who has tentatively accepted and electricity; M. Saab, Head of Planning for EdF, who has been invited, but is checking his schedule.

Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probably only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.  Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction here; stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half a block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had a genertor and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying, men reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.  A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs up and about; mistook that comotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much like after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my subconscious.  Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May need it.  Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and worried about them worrying about me.

He and Jeffrey will fly into Istanbul, arriving on June 24 (he asked me to  see if you knew the name of the hotel on the Bosporus - sp?)  They would stay  there until about the 28th or so, then the three of you would head to Nairobi  and stay at a few places.  Jeff mentioned Mt. Kenya Safari Club and another  place I can't even begin to spell or pronounce, but I'll figure that out  later...  You will need to be in Kilimanjaro for the safari on July 4.  The rough  sketch of the safari is as follows:  7/4 Arrive Kilimanjaro; overnight (O/N) at the Polo Club 7/5 Charter flight to Ngorongoro (fly over Mt. Kilimanjaro); O/N at  Ngorongoro Crater Lodge 7/6 Ngorongoro Crater tour; O/N at Crater Lodge 7/7 Drive to Monduli GCA; O/N Monduli TGTS camp 7/8 Hiking in Monduli; O/N Monduli TGTS camp 7/9 Flight to Kirawira, western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp 7/10 Western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp 7/11 Flight to Rubondo Island; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/12 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/13 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/14 Charter flight to Arusha; depart later that evening for the States/Turkey  Hope it sounds good to you.

First and foremost, I wanted to introduce Genesis Park which is a ""new economy"" investment company that's been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not looking for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the Enron/Genesis business relationship.  I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol is an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses which could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but hopefully it's worth some discussion.  If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly you could come to our ""offices"" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17 acres on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech shed on the property!

Unfortunately, it is not possible to add additional PRC Reps at this time  because all of the Associates and Analysts have been divided between the  existing PRC Reps.  Additionally, as you are aware, the PRC meetings are next  week, December 12th & 13th and there is not enough time to gather  information.  We will, however, be reducing the number of Associates and  Analysts that each PRC Rep is representing and will need several additional  Reps. If you have individuals that should be nominated please send the names  to Terry Bosien.  The parameters that were used for the initial appointments  were as follows:  The person must be a well-respected individual who is nominated/approved by  the Office of the Chair of the Operating Company The Associate PRC Reps are vice presidents The Analyst PRC Reps are directors /sr. directors  The level of the PRC reps on the committee is important to adhere to for  several reasons.  First, Jeff wanted individuals at these levels to gain  additional exposure in the organization and be involved in activities beyond  their business unit boundaries.  Additionally, it potentially places the PRC  Rep in an awkward position and they may feel undue pressure in the meeting if  they are required to disagree with a more senior individual.    We have also received request from individuals wanting to ""observe"" the  meeting.  As in the MD/VP process, individuals are not allowed to just  observe if they are not a part of the Committee.  We attempted to have the  major units represented, however, it is not possible to have every division  represented.   Jeff Skilling spent over an hour with the PRC Reps explaining  why the individuals selected as PRC Reps, rather than the Associates' &  Analysts' managers, should be the ones to represent the Associates & Analysts  in the PRC.  He also reiterated the importance of the PRC Reps'  responsibilities which was to (1) meet with the Associates' and Analysts'  managers;  (2) gather as much information as possible and (3) advocate  objectively for the individual. Also, if there are too many individuals in the room it is difficult or  impossible to come to a consensus, which has been the case in the past.    I hope this is helpful.  If business units find this is not acceptable, they  should seek approval for their attendance from Jeff Skilling.  Thanks for your understanding, cooperation and support.

These events led to the resignations of the central bank governor and treasury undersecretary and have tested the staying power of the country's three-party government coalition.  In response to this instability, the Turkish government appointed former World Bank Vice President, Kemal Dervis, as the new Minister of Economics in hopes of resuscitating the country's fledgling economy.  Ciller was elected Prime Minister in June 1993; her True Path party led several coalition governments until 1996.  After losing her seat in 1996, her party formed a coalition with the center-right Motherland Party which was followed by an alliance with the conservative far-right Welfare Party. The later move resulted in heightened tension between True Path and the military and business establishment.  In the current financial turmoil, Ms. Ciller has attempted to reposition herself as a force that will regain the nation's financial and political stability.

Financial Market Solutions (FMS) is a leading financial software company located in Bellevue, Washington. The company is dedicated to the development and implementation of Internet-based trading solutions for institutions in the global financial marketplace.  The central component of all FMS solutions is the Universal Trading Platform (UTP), which is a dynamic web-based platform that enables unlimited numbers of simultaneous users to access the system and execute trades on a fully automated basis. This basic premise distinguishes FMS from other solution providers and gives our clients the ability to more effectively manage the liquidity of multiple users, trading over the Internet on a single platform. The UTP has been fully developed as a complete Foreign Exchange dealing system, however, the same platform can be used for transactions in any tradable financial instrument.  FMS has employed a team of expert software designers and technicians as well as experienced professionals from the financial markets, who together have designed and developed the UTP to transform the way the FX product is delivered to end-users. The platform is equally suited to the needs of large institutional users as well as retail investors. The FMS system, using the latest technology, is the most advanced on-line trading system available today and will likely shape the FX business model of the future.  We have made some majorprogress over the last 15 months and are poised to announce some key relationships that will have a mojor impact in the FX industry.  I understand that you are very busy, and that this invitation is unsolicited but as they say nothing ventured nothing gained.    Kind Regards,  Kenny McBride V.P.

From Telge and HWY 290, keep going  north on 290 for 12 miles.  At the 11.5 mile mark you will see a Texaco  Station to your right.  Keep going past the intersection by the Texaco  station and turn right at your next opportunity (i.e. Roberts Road).  You  will see an ""Oakwood Homes"" pre-fab housing lot on the corner of 290 and  Roberts Road.  Turn right at Roberts Road, and go about 8/10 of a mile to Zube park (on your right). Park in the Northwest corner of the parking lot.  GROUPS OF 10-15 RIDERS ARE SENT OUT BASED ON RIDE SPEED, STARTING WITH THE  FASTER RIDERS AND WORKING DOWN TO THE MORE LIESURLY PACED RIDERS.

THIS IS A GREAT GROUP TO RIDE WITH IF YOU ARE NEW  TO CYCLING.  Questions:  Northwest Cyclery at 713-466-1240  Saturday - March 31 - Columbus - 8:00 AM - 56 miles - (hilly) Here is the Conoco series, sponsored by Steve Moskowitz - This is ride #12,  and there are 14 in the series, at a cost of $20 total.  Questions:  Patrick  Scales at Enron - 713-345-3673.  You read the note right - it says we're starting from COLUMBUS, Tx!  Sorry this note is a day late and still missing a key detail - the exact starting location - but due to the Round Top/Warrenton Antique Fair (100,000 visitors/day), we felt we needed to modify our route this Saturday.  There is a hilly 56 mile route which starts in Columbus and covers many of the same challenging hills as the ride originally planned but stays away from Round Top, Warrenton, and Fayetteville and the busy roads immediately around these towns.  Weekly Ride - Columbus, TX, Sat, 3/31 - 8 am  This week, we'll still get our hill training in and will have the opportunity to climb the same hill (Lone Oak) that we would have had to climb on the New Ulm route.  This ride is a 56 mile loop starting in Columbus, hitting Lone Oak and Frelsburg and picking up beautiful Zimmerscheidt Road going the other direction.  The Rides Around Houston book gives this ride a score of ""9"" for exercise potential so look for some hills.  The ride will start at 8:00 am sharp.  Columbus is an hour from the Sam Houston Tolway/I-10 intersection so please allow yourself time to arrive in Columbus by 7:15 am.  Directions to the Start - Beason's Park We have permission to use Beason's Park as the starting off point.  Someone is using the pavilion from 2:00pm to 7:00pm, and I told Judy that most of us would be gone by then and we didn't really need the pavilion.  Beason's Park does have restrooms, however, I will not vouch for the condition.  Beason's park is on US 90 just east of Columbus.  The most direct way is to take I-10 to exit 698 (US 90 exit) and take US 90 west.  The park is on the left hand side of the road just before the bridge over the Colorado river. For those of you (like us) coming from Magnolia/The Woodlands the best way is to take FM 949 to I-10.  We stay on the feeder which becomes US 90 at exit 698.  If you want to pick up food or go to the bathroom before the ride, stay on I-10 until exit 696 (Hwy 71).  There are convenience stores and bathrooms at this exit.  At this point you can either take Hwy 71 north to US 90 and turn right (east) to get to the park (which will be on your right just after the bridge) or get back on I-10 to exit 698.  NOTE - As we get out into the country, I highly recommend stopping at the local stores for your sport drinks, water, and a quick rest stop.  Your drinks will be colder this way, you will have a timely rest stop, and the local business will look forward to our return.  Here's a few reminders for those of you who are new to the list or have a short memory:  Starting Time - 8:00 am - SHARP! There were a lot of riders pulling into Cat Springs at 7:55 last Saturday. If you arrive in Columbus after 7:30 and aren't fast at bike prep and signing in, you'll get left at the start this week.  PLEASE allow time to get to Columbus between 7:15 and 7:30.  Even though we're not riding to Warrenton, we want to be off the roads as early as possible.  Check-in Process Every rider is expected to sign in to indicate that they have started the ride and sign-out on their return.  We have no way of knowing that you are on the road and may need assistance if you don't sign in.  PLEASE arrive early enough to sign in and remember to sign out when you finish the ride.  If you have completed the online or paper waiver, your name will appear on the alphabetical sign-in sheets.  They are split up into groups of 5-6 sheets to speed up the sign in process so look for the clip board with your name.  If this is your first ride and you haven't signed up online, you need to complete a paper waiver and fill in your name on the blank sign-in sheet. If you completed a paper waiver last Saturday and your name is not listed on the alpha list, it's because you didn't sign the waiver (3 of you), you signed one but didn't provide any emergency information, or I just couldn't read your handwriting (5 VERY sloppy waivers last week!).  PLEASE arrive early enough to fill out a legible waiver or slow down a minute when filling it out.  I hate to harp on these details but it is vital that everyone help out to ensure that you have a safe and fun ride.  Thanks! Stephen Moskowitz Conoco Inc.

Monday, June 05, 2000 9:15 AM  To:???? #10 Producers  Subject:??????? 2001 U.S. Open   The U.S. Open golf? tournament will be held at Southern Hills Country Club in  Tulsa next June 11-17.   With few exceptions the OPEN is never held this far south, thus making the  event very accessible to those of us in the Dallas area. This will mark the  3rd Open to be held at SHCC.  I've been asked to assist in the Corporate Hospitality for the event. Because  of this it is possibly to offer to your clients an invitation to one of the  world's preeminent sporting events. To see it live , to watch the drama  unfold in person, is an unforgettable moment. This is one reason why  companies want to secure a corporate hospitality package. Before I put the  word out in the Dallas market (and they will sell out soon) I wanted clients  of MHBT to have the first shot. (I think this is a fair privilage)  The tickets to the event are sold out already, so the only way to gain access  is via a hospitality package. They aren't cheap but the chance to have a U.S.  Open so close might never happen again. Prices are from? $28,500 to $150,000.  These prices range from a table in a furnished, shared pavilion to an  exclusive environment.   If you have anyone you think might be interested please let me know and I  will be happy to visit with them and describe all the amenities associated  with each option.   These started to go on sale in the Tulsa marketplace recently and several  options are SOLD OUT, including a few over $ 500,000.  Since demand is so high and space is limited I will hold off a week before  making non-MHBT clients aware of this opportunity of a lifetime.  Take advantage of getting your best clients into the 2001 U.S. Open.

With iSpheres, trading firms wrap applications like steel  marketplaces,  energy marketplaces, demand planning systems, and production  planning  systems as components, and derive additional business value by  monitoring  these components for real time interdependent events and then  reacting to  those?composite events  based on business rules.  iSpheres provides a software framework for developing and deploying these   loosely-coupled Web Services or Meta-Applications. These applications are   assembled from multiple components, each of which was previously itself an   application and data source, to enable new business processes.     For example, a $22 billion investment bank uses the iSpheres Meta   Application Framework,?to  detect and react to interdependent market events.  This enables them to optimize  and automate the acquisition and response to  relevant dynamic?events in  their Market Intelligence information  environment.

First and foremost, I wanted to introduce Genesis Park which is a ""new economy"" investment company that's been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not looking for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the Enron/Genesis business relationship.  I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol is an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses which could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but hopefully it's worth some discussion.  If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly you could come to our ""offices"" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17 acres on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech shed on the property!

With iSpheres, trading firms wrap applications like steel  marketplaces, energy marketplaces, demand planning systems, and production  planning systems as components, and derive additional business value by  monitoring these components for real time interdependent events and then  reacting to those?composite events  based on business rules.  iSpheres provides a software framework for developing and deploying these loosely-coupled Web Services or Meta-Applications. These applications are assembled from multiple components, each of which was previously itself an application and data source, to enable new business processes.    For example, a $22 billion investment bank uses the iSpheres Meta Application Framework,?to  detect and react to interdependent market events. This enables them to optimize  and automate the acquisition and response to relevant dynamic?events in  their Market Intelligence information environment.  The build out of the Internet and the rapid  deployment of eBusiness applications over last several years has established the  need and created the ability to build and deploy loosely-coupled Web Services or  Meta Applications.

Enron is participating in the  project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to  those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in  the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it  seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by  asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices  and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by  surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations.   I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our  participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network  Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20  minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will  be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific  practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If  you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those  of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the  survey.    Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for  contributing to this important learning opportunity.

From Telge and HWY 290, keep going  north on 290 for 12 miles.  At the 11.5 mile mark you will see a Texaco  Station to your right.  Keep going past the intersection by the Texaco  station and turn right at your next opportunity (i.e. Roberts Road).  You  will see an ""Oakwood Homes"" pre-fab housing lot on the corner of 290 and  Roberts Road.  Turn right at Roberts Road, and go about 8/10 of a mile to Zube park (on your right). Park in the Northwest corner of the parking lot.  GROUPS OF 10-15 RIDERS ARE SENT OUT BASED ON RIDE SPEED, STARTING WITH THE  FASTER RIDERS AND WORKING DOWN TO THE MORE LIESURLY PACED RIDERS.

THIS IS A GREAT GROUP TO RIDE WITH IF YOU ARE NEW  TO CYCLING.  Questions:  Northwest Cyclery at 713-466-1240  Saturday - March 31 - Columbus - 8:00 AM - 56 miles - (hilly) Here is the Conoco series, sponsored by Steve Moskowitz - This is ride #12,  and there are 14 in the series, at a cost of $20 total.  Questions:  Patrick  Scales at Enron - 713-345-3673.  You read the note right - it says we're starting from COLUMBUS, Tx!  Sorry this note is a day late and still missing a key detail - the exact starting location - but due to the Round Top/Warrenton Antique Fair (100,000 visitors/day), we felt we needed to modify our route this Saturday.  There is a hilly 56 mile route which starts in Columbus and covers many of the same challenging hills as the ride originally planned but stays away from Round Top, Warrenton, and Fayetteville and the busy roads immediately around these towns.  Weekly Ride - Columbus, TX, Sat, 3/31 - 8 am  This week, we'll still get our hill training in and will have the opportunity to climb the same hill (Lone Oak) that we would have had to climb on the New Ulm route.  This ride is a 56 mile loop starting in Columbus, hitting Lone Oak and Frelsburg and picking up beautiful Zimmerscheidt Road going the other direction.  The Rides Around Houston book gives this ride a score of ""9"" for exercise potential so look for some hills.  The ride will start at 8:00 am sharp.  Columbus is an hour from the Sam Houston Tolway/I-10 intersection so please allow yourself time to arrive in Columbus by 7:15 am.  Directions to the Start - Beason's Park We have permission to use Beason's Park as the starting off point.  Someone is using the pavilion from 2:00pm to 7:00pm, and I told Judy that most of us would be gone by then and we didn't really need the pavilion.  Beason's Park does have restrooms, however, I will not vouch for the condition.  Beason's park is on US 90 just east of Columbus.  The most direct way is to take I-10 to exit 698 (US 90 exit) and take US 90 west.  The park is on the left hand side of the road just before the bridge over the Colorado river. For those of you (like us) coming from Magnolia/The Woodlands the best way is to take FM 949 to I-10.  We stay on the feeder which becomes US 90 at exit 698.  If you want to pick up food or go to the bathroom before the ride, stay on I-10 until exit 696 (Hwy 71).  There are convenience stores and bathrooms at this exit.  At this point you can either take Hwy 71 north to US 90 and turn right (east) to get to the park (which will be on your right just after the bridge) or get back on I-10 to exit 698.  NOTE - As we get out into the country, I highly recommend stopping at the local stores for your sport drinks, water, and a quick rest stop.  Your drinks will be colder this way, you will have a timely rest stop, and the local business will look forward to our return.  Here's a few reminders for those of you who are new to the list or have a short memory:  Starting Time - 8:00 am - SHARP! There were a lot of riders pulling into Cat Springs at 7:55 last Saturday. If you arrive in Columbus after 7:30 and aren't fast at bike prep and signing in, you'll get left at the start this week.  PLEASE allow time to get to Columbus between 7:15 and 7:30.  Even though we're not riding to Warrenton, we want to be off the roads as early as possible.  Check-in Process Every rider is expected to sign in to indicate that they have started the ride and sign-out on their return.  We have no way of knowing that you are on the road and may need assistance if you don't sign in.  PLEASE arrive early enough to sign in and remember to sign out when you finish the ride.  If you have completed the online or paper waiver, your name will appear on the alphabetical sign-in sheets.  They are split up into groups of 5-6 sheets to speed up the sign in process so look for the clip board with your name.  If this is your first ride and you haven't signed up online, you need to complete a paper waiver and fill in your name on the blank sign-in sheet. If you completed a paper waiver last Saturday and your name is not listed on the alpha list, it's because you didn't sign the waiver (3 of you), you signed one but didn't provide any emergency information, or I just couldn't read your handwriting (5 VERY sloppy waivers last week!).  PLEASE arrive early enough to fill out a legible waiver or slow down a minute when filling it out.  I hate to harp on these details but it is vital that everyone help out to ensure that you have a safe and fun ride.  Thanks! Stephen Moskowitz Conoco Inc.

This landmark program, already underway, will be assisted by many dedicated volunteers from throughout the community.  Led by Chairman Gene Vaughan, the Center, an affiliate of the Greater Houston Partnership, is focused on very tough questions:  The world and Houston are changing rapidly - what will be the new reality in 20 years and beyond? What do we want Houston to be?  What are the obstacles and trade-offs? Most of all, what plans, resources, determination and leadership are necessary now to get Houston to its desirable future?  If you are interested in what can be done to give Houston a great future worthy of its past - and particularly if you want to get involved - this is an outstanding opportunity to discourse with one of the citizens leading the charge.

He is chairman and has served as a director since 1970 of Dreyfus Founders Group of mutual funds (Denver).  Mr. Vaughan has been a trustee of Vanderbilt University (Nashville) since 1972.  He is a director since 1990 and on the Executive Committee of the Greater Houston Partnership.  He is Chairman of the Center for Houston=01,s Future whose mission is to help prepare Houston proactively for future opportunities and challenges.

To help address this, I recently replaced Ralph in a group of UK CEOs  which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's  businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around  two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current  business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows.

Apparently, Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the  presenters was inaccurate; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you  would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the  SUN demonstration.    With Jeff out of town until Monday, I would really like to have someone  contact the presenters before the end of the week.  Is this going to be  possible?  I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.  In the meantime, below are  the links to the presenters' bios, which I believe include their phone  numbers.  Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them.    Additionally, I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we  have to date.  I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to  reconsider the buffet idea, with seating scattered around the facility, and  the meeting room set up ""class room"" style.  If we go with the plated  breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 ""10-tops,"" there will be no  space for a screen, podium, AV equipment, etc.  If we have more than 120  people (I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing  to come in), we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting  room.  In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the  YPO group, I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and  will walk in just in time for the presentations.  I think you guys and Jeff  are scheduled to meet next Tuesday, so perhaps that can be discussed then.  I'll give you a call tomorrow, Mike.

While Jeff would probably be to modest to tell you himself, I thought you  might be interested to know that he has been named the National MS Society's  2000 Man of the Year, and will be honored at a dinner on September 30.  He  has been a big supporter of the MS Society, primarily through his riding the  MS150 from Houston to Austin since 1997.  This year's ride is April 15-16,  and he has been busy collecting pledges - $20,000 so far, which will be  matched by the Enron dollar-for-dollar.  Enron Corp. has the largest MS150  team in the nation in terms of dollars raised, and this year our goal is  $350,000.  It appears that our 378-person team has already blown through that  goal and is well on its way to raising $400,000.  As MS has touched my  family, I am very proud to be associated with a man and a company who so  actively support research to find a cure.  I'm sure Jeff will write a personal note when he returns to town and sends  his check.  In the meantime, good luck with your fund raising, and have a  nice weekend.

We very much hope you can join us to be presented  with the Award at the Risk  2000 Europe Congress in Paris on April 11th - we  invite you to attend the  conference as a full delegate and I am sure there are a  number of sessions  which will be of interest to you. A formal invitation will  follow from our  editor.  We also intend to publish a special  supplement that will provide Awards  winners with an excellent opportunity to  celebrate their achievements  through advertising.  This supplement will be distributed with the  March issue of Risk and to all  delegates attending the Risk 2000  Congress.

Don't miss this new and exciting event.  Make your reservations today.  See meeting details below. **********************************************  Harvard University Club of Houston - Harvard Forum =01&Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence=018 Dinner and Discussion Club  Join us for a new type of Harvard Club experience.  Ever wanted to talk substantively about a topic, while having a great dinner, but were afraid that your dinner guests would not be able to go the distance with you in the conversation?  We have the solution.  Modeled after a format that members David and Anne Grizzle and Danguole Spakevicius and William Altman have been enjoying for years, the Harvard Forum will provide an opportunity for an extended conversation with fellow club members.  The format works like this:  we=01,ll have dinner, and then a panel of Harv= ard grads will give brief introductions to the evening=01,s topic from their perspective, and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves, first in a large group and then in small groups.  The panel members will be knowledgeable, but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated.  They will, however, be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation is lively.  You will come away knowing your fellow club members better than ever - maybe better than you ever wanted.  The topic we=01,ve picked is one with which many of us have struggled.  Our children may be growing up in a world far more affluent - privileged - than we enjoyed.  How imperiled is their character by our success?  What practical steps can we take to insure that we pass along to them the character values that we treasure?  We plan to schedule a Harvard Forum every quarter.  Because of the format, attendance is limited.  Please respond as indicated below.  When:    Friday, May 18, 7:30 p.m. Where:   Briar Club, 2603 Timmons (East Briar Room) Cost:      $35.00 per person  Reservations:  Email dottie@kerr-solutions.com or call 281/424-3084 (Payment must be made at time of reservation by credit card or mailing check to 3413 Cobblestone Lane, Baytown, TX 77521-1956.)

Best regards, Jeff     Jay Fitzgerald@ECT 05/09/2001 08:55 AM To: Jeff Skilling/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: My Resignation, and a Question  Jeff-  As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.   For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley  about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily  for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which,  while it is disappointing to me, I accept.  The purpose of this note is twofold.  First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it  is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I  will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.  Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term  Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital  community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future  payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some  very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to  cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think  that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if  I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.  At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer  enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned  professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this  note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too  presumptuous!).  Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not  wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.  Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep  up the great work!

To help address this, I recently replaced Ralph in a group of UK CEOs  which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's  businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around  two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current  business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows.  The group has asked if you would like to chair the meeting in September 2001  on a date of your choice.  At the end of this note there is a list of the  current membership.  I have been to one meeting and only around a third  attended.  Please let me know if you are able to commit time to this.  There is no  problem if you decline.

First and foremost, I wanted to introduce Genesis Park which is a ""new economy"" investment company that's been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not looking for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the Enron/Genesis business relationship.  I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol is an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses which could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but hopefully it's worth some discussion.  If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly you could come to our ""offices"" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17 acres on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech shed on the property!

My colleague, Cory Christensen (another McKinsey alum), and I met with IBM regarding a potential strategic relationship. That meeting went far better than expected. A similar document to the one I sent to you has now reached a number of their senior executives. Tom Bouchard, SVP of Human Resources, for example, reacted by saying, ""They're (e-rehab) addressing a huge problem. I would love to talk to them."" one of their senior healthcare VPs stated, ""This is exactly the kind of thing IBM would like to do. This is not the only big thing we're looking at, but this is definitely big. It's right on!"" The table has turned. IBM is now pushing us with information requests and to move the process along.  We told IBM that e-rehab is most interested in them as a customer, as is the case with Enron and another half dozen blue-chip companies with which we have initiated a dialogue. However, because IBM has come to recognize the relevance and potential value we can deliver, they are now keenly interested in becoming a minority investor (assuming that we clear their due diligence screens).  The meeting with IBM last Friday was in Stamford Connecticut so I arranged a meeting just prior to that with Steve Denning in Greenwich. Our visit was meant to be purely social, but Steve reacted quite positively to our business and would be interested in considering an investment by General Atlantic Partners (GAP) if we sign up an IBM ... or one or more companies of similar stature, such as Enron. Aside from GAP and our current investors, we are not considering traditional funding sources. GAP is an exception because of their potential non-monetary value-added.  In any case, the purpose of this note is to solicit a reaction to my earlier e-mail. In other words, would Enron have an interest as a potential (early adopter) customer and/or strategic investor? I would not have approached you in the first place unless I was convinced that our services would be of great benefit to Enron. If you have an interest in exploring this opportunity, I'd like to determine and schedule next steps. I apologize. I don't mean to be pushy, but I'm anxious and feel a great deal of urgency.  I'll place a call to your office next week to get a read on your temperature. Look forward to getting a response.

The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of  $15.76.   This price was increased to $16.00 to encompass trades transacted  via the telephone.   The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:  Nicor Gas Company was closed for  their company holiday on Friday, December  22nd.  As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for  the December  22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December  22-26 time period.  Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December  22nd (even though they were closed)  for the December 23-26 time period,  which resulted in a $13.88 posting for the December 23-26th period.  I  received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing  concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal  activity that transacted on December 22nd.    While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online,  from time-to-time, there will be significant volumes transacted over the  telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.

In answer to your question, there are no special requirements.  Back in the  day, they would have been looking for actual pipeline scheduling experience,  but anymore, the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low, that they will  consider most people, with an analytical or coordinative type background.  I  think it's one of those things that once you ""get your foot in the door"", you  can move on from there.  Just be aware, that if you were to become a gas scheduler, it may require  working on weekends, and late nights from time to time.  As far as the next step, I would suggest that you just simply send an e-mail  to George Smith, Manager of Logistics on the Central Desk, and ask him if he  has time to visit with you.  I think that by simply expressing an interest,  and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler, and also, learning  what you can expect to learn from him, should serve as the first step.    Also, if he is interested, and does not have a position currently open, then  he will pass on your name to some of the other managers.  They're actually  pretty good about that!  I'll mention to George that you may give him a call.  Let me know if you have any further questions, or want to visit some more!  Take care!

The weather was a little chillier than Houston, and as a  result I have a little cold and sore throat.  The wedding was very nice.  The  wedding itself was in a small church, but somewhat elegant.  The reception  was ""the bomb"".  It was in a real nice resort and it was money, money,  money.  I was really wondering where my cousin got all of the money.  She had  a reception for around 150 to 250 people.  I'm not good at looking at a crowd  and judging, but I bet it was around that many folks there.  She had a buffet  dinner (mainly sandwiches, but they were good), all kind of party favors,  beautiful cake, 5 layers and each layer was something different, a band, a dj  and a comedian that had been on BET that they flew in from Dallas.  It was  really nice.  Again, I hope she did not go into too much debt, but it was  nice.  She had a really wonderful time and she was a nice-looking bride.  We  went shopping and sight-seeing.  We even went to go find the grade school  that we attended and the house that we lived in when we lived in Phoenix   many, many years ago.  It was alot of fun actually remincescing (you know  what word I'm trying to say).  Did you go to church Sunday?  If so, how was it?  I really did miss not going  to church.   How was the rest of your weekend?  Kids and Steve doing okay?  I  can't wait to see you tomorrow night, it seems likes it been a long time.  Talk to you later.

I sent you and Momma some new pictures of the boys, if you  have not received yet, you should receive either today or Tuesday.  I made  the hotel reservations for Phoenix at the Embassey Suites, the rate is  $159.00 per night, pretty expensive, but the Nascar is in town, and we can  split it three ways.  Hopefully, there is a sofa sleeper in the room,  although I did not ask, I asked for two queen beds, in case there is not.   Now I just need to get the car reserved and we're all set.  I spoke with  Shawna on Friday and asked her to check with her wedding coordinator to see  if she could improve that rate, so far I have not heard anything back from  her yet, nor am I holding my breath.  She said her colors are burgundy and  gold, if I remember correctly.    Jordan is still taking gymnastics and his coach came over and told me that  Jordan was so good, that he would like Jordan to be in an accelerated class  for his age group.  This class is called the ""Hope Team""  and it gets the  kids ready for competition.  I did not realize he was that good, although I  could clearly see that he was the best in his class (proud Mom).  I called to  inquire about the cost, and the receptionist quickly told me"" Ma'm you have  to be invited to be in that class, you just can't enroll, and I said, yes,  ma'm we have been invited to enroll, thank you very much!""   Well, anyway, we'll  see b/c the class is from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. each day.   We'll see, I know he would really enjoy it. Kendall is enrolled for his first gynmastics class beginning October 23rd.  I  was thinking he would really enjoy it, but the more I think about it, he'll  probably want to be in Jordan's class (oh boy!!).

I know tonight is study night for her spelling test, so I probably won't talk  to you tonight.  Rev. Jackson called me yesterday.

He then  went on to say that he didn't want any problems or misunderstandings, because  I was a generous contributor.  I then proceeded to give him a piece of my  mind, because they need to get serious about the business end of the church.

The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of  $15.76, but coupled with the volume not transacted online, this price was  estimated to be a $16.00 midpoint.  Specificially the following trades were  transacted over the telephone:  Nicor Gas Company  $18.16  20,000  Via ANR @ Hampshire Altrade    GDD +.05 10,000  NGPL Nicor WPS    GDD    5,000  NGPL Nicor Nicor Gas Company  $12.00  20,000  NGPL Nicor PG&E    $14.00   9,000  NGPL Nicor Kaztex    $18.16       4,000  NBPL/Nicor    The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:  Nicor Gas Company observed their company holiday on December 22nd, while most  companies observed the company holiday on December 26th.  As a result,  volumes were traded for the December 22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published  a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period.  Nicor Gas Company made  a decision to buy gas on December 22nd for the December 23-26 time period.  I  received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing  concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal  activity that transacted on December 22nd.    While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online,  from time-to-time, the there will be significant volumes transacted over the  telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.  My volume  is a little  over-stated, but simply  from a cursory glance standpoint, as opposed to  intentionally reporting erroneous information.

With respect to the 15 million of increased VAR that the Board allocated to  Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling I propose the following:  1.  5 Million be allocated to EES and therefore remove EES's positions from  the Wholesale gas and power groups (This has already been done).  2.  Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the  trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherriff).  3.  With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the  ""Cross Commodity Trading Group"" which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and  use it as it sees fit (I will run this group and currently be the only  employee).  This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we  need to throw more VAR at certain positions (I see the individual trading  groups staying within their VAR limits).  However, I do see the need for a  true cross commodity group that would search for low risk / high probability  trades accross the commodities that we trade.  This structure may help to  start us down this path.  Please let me know what you think.

Just in Case  *  Managed a Trading group that is up 2 Billion (more if you included hits  taken) - probably not due to me. *  Left a lot of money in Canada - some is still there. *  Led the PPA deal - which I will resign and buy personally if you want to  turn it back. *  Created the Gas Fundamentals Group which every business unit is copying. * Came up with LTP which everybody hates but will fix our trader shortage in  the future and every company is copying. *  Trained many great young kids in Calgary that are now key players in  Houston. *  Created structure and communication around our system strategy - brought  traders, IT, and back office together to create a plan that everyone has  bought into.  The future success is unclear but the exercise was very  worthwhile. *  Had very few VAR violations and helped improve our understanding and  reporting of VAR.  Completed mended the relationship between gas trading and  the risk group. *  Should get most credit for the increase in power trades on EOL and the  continuation of the increase in Gas. *  Turned the East Power group into a focused trading group not a think tank  that bets on July-Aug power price - Still nowhere near completion. *  Put a halt on the hiring of unqualified people - Have spent many hours  devising a plan to bring in qualified - experience people.  You will see this  implemented in 2001. *  Experimented with the ""Pay PRC""  which I think was very successful.  I  think this will start our organization to think a little differently and  hopefully in a way that will benefit us. *  Possibly the best accomplishment is ""Killing the Dragon"".

Systems,"I thought I would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list  of agreed apon tasks.  1.  The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we  have huge business risk if it blows up.    -->  Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to  maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.           (everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds  like it should be a high priority)  2.  The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to  long hours on the part of our back office staff.     -->  Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to  address the problem.  We have 4 contractors working on this and we are  expecting it to take 6 weeks.  Once this project is complete we can add  hardware and reduce the time problems.  3.   The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately  combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real  time risk. TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the  traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by  the               traders to meet their needs.    -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in  consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to  come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.  4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  This is  leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  Beth has made  progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the  next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.  5.  Steve Natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin  Presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements  deals and volume management deals in the east.  6.  There will be no more business trips to London (somewhat kidding).  7.  Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their  books through an interface with Houston.     -->  John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its  worthwile to put servers in Portland.       -->  Since Tim was not in the meeting, John will make sure we are covering  all his needs.",False,False,0.0228962962962963,0.07285185185185185,0.613,0.09188888888888888,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,,"Philippe A Bibi, Mark Frevert",Sent,John J Lavorato,LAVORATO-J,"Beth Perlman, Sally Beck, Kristin Albrecht, Phillip K Allen, Hunter S Shively, Jeffrey A Shankman, David W Delainey, Brent A Price, Steve Nat, Kevin M Presto, Tim Belden"

Garrett is in Toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to  understand all the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including  building forward curves.  He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the  Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the  Northeast U.S.).  Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for  Ontario.    2.  My current opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto  office with risk management responsibilities rolling into Dana.  This could  always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.  3.  John Mckay, although he has been helping Bill out, will ultimately have  no power trading responsibilities.  4.

I thought I would rewrite yours and correct some of  the factual errors.  If you disagree please write me back.  I moved from our Houston office in 1994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named  President of the Canadian operation.  We went from a small gas marketing shop  to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada.  It was  absolutely awesome.  I had the time of my life.  We built the business with  very little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's  bottom line.  These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading  and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create  liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others.   So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help  build revolutionary new businesses.  What a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk  management presence is in Natural Gas and Power.  The opportunities our  outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.  These  businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different  variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage  in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina.  You can't  put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other  commodities.  Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to  figure out what the Fed is going to do.  It has much more complexity, and if  you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it.....get down  here! .... we need you!

I have a question about a sequence of  events. For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is ""Energy curtailed""  (Index = 10843), THEN it has the message ""Turbine Com Established"" (Index =  10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a ""Energy  curtailed"" message (Index = 11134).  Is there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment  messages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established  message was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no  message was recorded?

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new  building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being  offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.  This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the  new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The  cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is  currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly  employee cost of $94.00.  If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to  the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made  as spaces become available.   The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be  opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street  level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available.  Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an  exit in the event of elevator trouble.   If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to  Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your  email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and  receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new  garage.  The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and  Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.   (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians,  will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

I realize that there may be bigger  issues being worked on currently, but would it be possible for EOL to survey  Enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements??   For example, I'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack  manager.

As reported previously in the trade press, Petal Gas Storage has decided to  build its own pipeline to connect its storage facility in Forrest Co., MS to  interconnections with Southern Natural, Destin, and Transco in Clarke and  Jasper Cos., MS.  We have received FERC's notice of the application (Docket  No. CP01-69), and will be filing an intervention before the February 20  deadline.  Southern Company Services has contracted for the full 700,000  Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.  The project calls for about 59  miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compressor station at a cost of  about $94,343,700.  As part of its application, Petal also submitted pro forma tariff provisions  and rates for firm and interruptible transportation services and asked for  authority to charge negotiated rates.  Petal also requested approval of  certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreement for the  contract with Southern, apparently to allow Southern to act as agent for its  affiliated operating electric utilities to apportion capacity among them.  Please advise if you have any issues with Petal that should be made a part of  our intervention.  The certificate application is 635 pages, not including  another 778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request  a copy unless someone indicates a desire to review it.

While we ar= e=20 still confident that UBS will perform well and place a large number of unit= s,=20 their allocations as lead manager in our past deals probably soaked up a=20 great deal of demand for NBP units within their system.

Also, Dain Rauscher was recently acquired b= y=20 Royal Bank of Canada, which provides commercial bank lending to NBP and NBP= L,=20 so NBP will be able to leverage DR=01,s participation in future debt=20 transactions.

I was like ""Look it's Dad!!!  Cool!!!!""  Unfortunately there was no one here to tell that to but it's ok.  I'm glad you had fun.  I ordered flowers last night for Mom for Mother's Day and for DK for her b-day.  I hope that's ok.  I didn't know what to get Debbie, but I know I always like flowers so I thought those would be good.  I'm glad my car is ok.  Please thank Debbie for me, and I'll thank her as soon as I get the chance.  By the way, I'm not coming home this weekend because Mom didn't want me to drive home this weekend and then turn around and come home again on Tuesday (reading days). David is going to drive up here for the weekend, and we are going to go to some of the Fiesta festivities around here and the big FiestaFest concert here on Friday night.  I will be home on Tuesday night though after classes and will switch back cars then.  (I'll be home Tuesday till Friday morning to bring a load of stuff home and study.  I also wanted to be there for the munchkins' b-day party - it is the first one and all.)  Thanks so much for taking care of my car and letting me borrow the Beemer.  It's been nice having it!!!  I hope you are having a great day and I'll talk to you tonight.  I love you!!!     Love,     Caron PS - Thanks for letting the horses go to Nacodoches last weekend.  Rose won both the costume class and championship so she's qualified for Nationals in that now, and Ricki won his driving so he's qualified now too.  Rose got 3rd out of 6 in sidesaddle, but Jennifer said it was her and not Rose (fred said so too!!).  I'll have to get that qualification in San Antonio.  I just thought you'd like to know and tell you thanks for giving me some more classes to ride at Nationals.  Maybe I'll actually win something there this time around!!!  ----- Original Message ----- From: <Stanley.Horton@enron.com> To: <Caron.Horton@Trinity.edu> Sent: Wednesday, April 25, 2001 7:56 AM Subject: Good morning   > The game was awesome.

Peggy, Joyce's reason for requesting an exception for Mary Turina (front  loading and increasing retention bonus or guarantee payment of sales bonus)  is ""Due to the special nature of the trading floor and the on-going need we  have to retain people in this area""...here's how I see it  Factors: (1) seems like Mary just went into that position...but, if she's already  established a reputation and is being heavily recruited, then maybe a higher  number on retention is justifiable (2) she works 80% - i know that's not indicative of productivity, but it  seems our flexibility should be worth something in the retention bucket (3) she only has about $100k of unvested equity remaining (4) as currently contemplated, Piro and Lesh would get about $250k (compared  to $200k for Mary) in retention value - but this points back to (2) somewhat  and potential internal inequity issues if increased values or exceptions get  out  The most important factors are: (5) the risk of losing Mary to a competitor and  (6) whether that loss would significantly disrupt the sale process or ongoing  operations of PGE If these factors are, in fact, problems, then it probably makes sense to  increase Mary's retention bonus.  If we get into front loading her retention  bonus, then I'd want to get some strong non-compete and non-solicitation  language in the documents.  The reason for front-loading the retention grants  for Fowler/Miller is to provide some consideration/incentive for giving up  ""window"" payments.  Peggy, if you still feel strongly about increasing Mary's retention bonus  after reviewing my thoughts, I don't have a problem with $250k, but if we  start to get into the $300k - $400k range or front-loading any portion, I'd  like to get Stan's sign-off.

I had propposed Quennoz and Johnson going to $250,000., which gets them to previous level, and Ryder to $225,000., and that Barnett would need an increase to keep equity to $225,000. If $250,000. is too high for Johnson and Quennoz, I could probably be OK with $225,000. for each of them, but they should be as high as Nichols, and Barnett should also be as high as Nichols. 3)I had also had Joyce Bell ask you a question about Mary Turina, and payment of sales bonus at earlier of sale or some timeframe like 2 to 3 years. Probably what I'm really suggesting here, is maybe we need to increase her retention, and decrease her sales or something like that, and a front loading might work here too, with incentive to have to stay.

Stephen.Dyer@bakerbotts.com on 04/26/2001 10:54:38 AM To: Stanley.Horton@enron.com cc: david.hill@msdw.com, Adam.Schucher@bakerbotts.com   Subject: important - something for you to ponder, and then respond please   David Hill put us in touch with Marco Crespi, who is at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Trust FSB in New Jersey.  There is no local office of MSDW Trust, and by local I mean in the State of Texas (not just Houston).  Marco assures us that MSDW Trust has authority to conduct trust business in all 50 states and is sending us evidence of same.  I am not worried about their authority to do trust business here, but I am worried a bit about what I explain below.  Marco has informed us that, since MSDW Trust has no local presence, they will not accept appointments to the more personal or high contact positions, such as agent (attorney-in-fact) under a Statutory Durable Power of Attorney and executor under a Last Will and Testament.  Basically, all they take at this point are trustee appointments.  This obviously puts a kink in your plans as outlined at our meeting in your office on April 3 with David Hill and in our follow-up e-mails.  We have rough drafts of your documents in process and expected to send you some first drafts by mid-week next week, but all those drafts name MSDW Trust to the various positions you had in mind, some of which we now know are not feasible.  If you want to name MSDW Trust as co-trustee on all the trusts, whether created now or under your Will, that will work fine.  However, you will not very well be able to bridge the gap during any period of incapacity (under a Power of Attorney) or during any period of estate administration (under a Will) with another corporate fiduciary as co-agent or co-executor who then is expected to hand off to MSDW Trust as trustee.  In other words, if you really want MSDW Trust in there for the long haul as co-trustee on all the trusts (both now and after your death), your best bet is probably to have only an individual serve as agent or executor (say your wife, for example), as those jobs are temporary, to bridge the gap until the trusts are fully funded after your estate administration is completed.  If you have any reticence about naming only an individual as agent or executor (again, say your wife), you might consider having two individuals named together as co-agent and co-executor to ameliorate your concerns (say Caron with your wife?).  Of course, if you want to shop around town a bit for a corporate fiduciary who could and would serve as co-agent and co-executor, we can provide a list of several banks and trust companies and introduce you to most in the city.

You favor MSDW, though, and I'd like to help you work out a plan that uses them.  Please let me know your thoughts, as I know you are eager to put at least some of this to bed soon, and Adam Schucher (here at Baker Botts) has prepared first drafts that require only my review and revisions prior to sending them to you.

At the same time FERC's approval of the effort by the 9 NW utilities (IOUs plus BPA) to form RTO West was conditioned on making a 12/1/01 compliance filing that addresses seams issues with California and Canada, and a timetable for creating a West-wide RTO. Together, these orders should help prevent California's efforts to balkanize their power system. 4)FERC's order on RTO West gave a boost to the inclusion within the RTO of the independent-for-profit transmission company (TransConnect) proposed by 6 of the 9 RTO utilities including PGE. Relying heavily on TransConnect's independence, the Commission approved TransConnect's proposal to file for innovative and incentive rates. 5)Wholesale sales continue strong in a robust market. 6)Thermal plants are in sequential annual  maintenance outages. 7)Hydro plants operations are reduced due to poor water condition in NW. 8)Contract negotiations continue with IBEW Local 125. Next meeting is scheduled for May 7. 9)Customer Information System installation is approaching 75% completion, being on schedule, and under budget. 10)Joint Meter Reading project is on target with 850,000 routes now merged with NW Natural Gas. 11)SB 1149, Oregon's version of deregulation, is still uncertain in the legislature. We are ready to implement on whatever timeframe is decided. 12)We plan to submit another fast track small microturbine generating plant for RAROC next week. 13)Senator Gordon Smith reception held to keep contact on issues around price caps, and there determental effect on energy markets and new generation.      >>> Horton, Stanley 04/23/01 02:57PM >>> I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less) bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each Friday.

Over the last month,  Diane and I have met several times to transition the Azurix Public Relations  function into ETS. Shelley and I also met with John Garrison. As you know,  Azurix has a lot of irons in the fire and many of them could turn into public  relations challenges.  Azurix has PR employees in Buenos Aires, Ontario, and California. These  employees were notified by Diane that I was taking over the Azurix PR  function and to coordinate their activity through me. I've spoken to a few of  the PR employees. To summarize what Azurix might face in the near future, here's what Diane and  John provided me and Shelley:  ? Offers to purchase Azurix North America are due May 24. John anticipates  spending one month reveiwing the offers and making management presentations.  As a deal is done and made public, information and responses to the media  will be coordinated with Mark Hudson in Ontario.  ? The Madera project in California continues. Cole Frates is on the ground in  California and I will coordinate with Cole as issues surface.  ? Gustavo Pedace is on the ground in Buenos Aires. If I had to guess, this is  where Azurix has the most exposure. As July and August approach, we'll know  more about the direction of Azurix Buenos Aires.  ? As things transpire with the other assets, I'll coordinate PR activity with  the contacts on the ground. Mark Palmer and his staff know that ETS is  involved in Azurix.  I have a phone call into John Shafer to discuss the use of the crisis center  in case of an Azurix emergency. This is a precautionary measure that I hope  we don't have to use. Please let me know if you would like to discuss Azurix and the PR function  further.

We both told him that the best way approach GISB regarding his product was to consider membership and certification if it applied, and to send in a request if he thought that standards should be developed.  We also told him that our organization has been very receptive to requests for standards development, and have only declined to process a handful of requests because they were out of scope.  If he considered that the request for standards would improve and streamline the marketplace for natural gas, and that it met both the mission and scope of our organization, it would have a good chance of moving forward.  Our plate right now is pretty full, as it always has been, but that has never stopped a company from requesting that additional standards be development.  We also told him we would help him to write the request if needed and looked forward to working with him in the future.  I am not sure that he will follow up with us on membership, certification or providing a request which would go through our normal process.  I will keep you updated as or if this progresses.

A J Mohring <amohring@juno.com> on 05/07/2001 09:36:35 PM To: Stanley.Horton@enron.com cc:    Subject: Retirement   May 7, 2001   Stan Horton Chairman and Chief Exective Officer  Dear Mr. Horton:  Thank you for your letter of congratulation on my recent retirement.  I would like to make a suggestion, for the retirement plan for others.          When the 27 page retirement letter is sent, that a time table of when items will be in place or transferred         be included. (3-9 months or when)          Medical Forms can't be put in now until after you leave.  I went back to the office to HR and they put         the information in the system.  Two weeks after I left I called to see when I would receive the card (Dr.         offices like to see the card).  I was tolled I wasn't even in the system.  So I called back to Omaha HR         and they worked to get it in place.  When I went to get a RX  I was not in that system either and had to         come home and call HR and start over with that system.          The only part of the funds that are transferred as of this date is the Cash Balance Plan.  The Savings         Plan and ESOP are not transferred to my Financial Plan.  They tell me they will be; this is why I feel           a timeline would be helpful.  Until I received my Medical Card I put off going to the Dr.  Also I haven't         wanted to take a trip because, I am unsure of when funds will be transferred.           Last week I received a letter from a transfer Company out of NY. with (2) shares of  ENRON                 stock.  So I called NY to see what Fund that was from,  they didn't know they were just to set up a     account.  I called the Enron retirement line and they didn't know what Fund that was from either.          Many of the people who answers the phones about any of this just don't have answers.  ENRON employees have been well taken care of while we are working, this doesn't seem like that in retirement.  I share this because I know your are always working to improve ENRON.

I will attempt to get educated first and  then we will set up a meeting.  Thanks for being so cooperative.   From: PEGGY FOWLER/ENRON@enronxgate on 05/09/2001 11:18 AM To: Stanley Horton/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:    Subject: Re: Business Review  I agree that makes a lot of sense, that is certainly where we are spending our time, and good management of that so far, is what is contributing to earnings higher than expected....that and the crazy California markets. We're always glad to have you visit, and could provide a detailed discussion if that's what you would prefer. We are spending a great deal of time on this in the sales presentations and have a number of overheads, and some written information that we use in our position meetings that we could send to you to start with. The rate case is in a very dynamic state, but we believe moving in right direction. The power position is in constant review based on projected loads, demand side management opportunities, and blocks of energy available at reasonable prices in the future for our customers. We are still operating under an obligation to serve, as we don't see that changing anytime in the near future and those utilities in the west that have gotten in trouble are those who haven't provided for customers. Commissions seem to be giving rate increases for increasing prices if prudent management was attempted, but not just for stopping based on possible belief of dereg. We have a sharing mechanism right now that shares risks and rewards between customers and shareholders. During this sales process we had spent a lot of time working through with Sierra on this, and now with the new possible buyers. Most like it when they finally understand. It is not regulation 101, it is very complex and leading edge, but get the risks and rewards aligned much better for shareholdes and customers. Doesn't fit Enron's view of dereg, but Oregon will not get to Enron's view anytime soon, especially with California situation, and it's not just Oregon regulators, it's Oregon customers including the industrials that are  reliability sensitive like high techs and health care.  Sorry for the long note....how about if I start by sending you some information from presentations, and then we can look at schedules for when a meeting might work. You might even want to come to one of the banker presentations. Mark M and Mitch were both in Seattle yesterday, and could share with you some of the discussion related to these subjects. Mitch thought we might have another in a week or so.....        >>> Horton, Stanley 05/08/01 09:37AM >>> After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE business review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand better.  The first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial exposures to changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy to return to Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast of players.  I am open to suggestions from you.  Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.  Thanks!

Let me know when  you want to discuss comp issues.     Adam_Umanoff%ENRON@eott.com on 04/29/2001 12:23:55 PM To: Stanley_Horton%Enron.com%Eott@EOTT.COM cc:    Subject: EWC - Weekly Update/Week Ending 27 April   1.  Aura.      -  Received revised bid from UBS which Metts describes as ""real.""  UBS will now commence detailed 6-8 week due diligence on EWC (at Enron's expense if deal busts).  Confidence re: UBS' ability to execute remains mixed.      -  LJM (Fastow) interest continues, but unclear how parallel process can be run.  Umanoff concerned about conflict when management assists seller as part of UBS deal but assists buyer as part of LJM deal.      -  Now that '01 numbers scrubbed, in process of revising '02 financial projections based on detailed internal review (as of December, 2000, '02 EBITDA projected at approximately $115mm; up from 1CE '01 projection of $78mm). This is unrealistic; I expect 2002 EBITDA in the $90-95mm range, showing solid 15-20% EBITDA growth.  2.  M&A Activity.      -  acquisition of assets of bankrupt Dutch blade manufacturer, Aerpac, continues; we have closed on several assets and expect final closing in May.      -  sale of Greek operating projects to German buyer continues, but execution uncertain.  Closing targeted for June 30.  Sale of Greek development company also launched, with 2 parties expressing interest.  3.  2001 Commercial Activity.      -  US backlog remains firm.  Projected demand continues to exceed our projected turbine supply.  Key execution issue is confimation of suitability of 1.5 MW turbine (primarily its gearbox) in more rigorous US wind regimes.      -  American Electric Power has provided indicative bid to purchase the two Texas projects we have under development (Indian Mesa I and Clear Sky); indicative bid price is attractive.  AEP has requested Enron Corp guaranty of EWC's turbine warranty, like they have received on previous sales with EWC.  Enron Corp guaranty is approved internally, but, in light of Aura, we will continue to bargain for no Enron Corp credit support. Finally, debt financing expected to close on IMI in May and debt circled on Clear Sky in June.  Turbine suitability due diligence is key pacing item for debt closing.      -  European backlog remains firm, expect for Spanish sales of 750kw turbine, which remains soft. EWC attended Hannover Fair last week, the largest industrial trade show in Europe.  Our exhibit was very well received.  CEO of German competitor, Enercon, approached Umanoff to discuss IP issues (Enercon is currently barred from US market on patent infringement grounds).  4.  HR Issues.      -  US has lost O&M director and 2 key commercial employees have expressed concerns.  Need to finalize retention program (Umanoff to discuss with Horton early in week).      -  Key recruiting initiatives are: GM Spain; head of global procurement/blade MFG; European GC.  Umanoff would also like to re-visit hiring US GM/MD, as day-to-day US operations require more detailed oversight than Umanoff is currently providing; not clear if we can recruit for this position in the midst of Aura.  Stan - for the future, please let me know whether this is the right level of focus.  Talk with you soon.

Wessex will provide ED with its I&C database and, should Wessex decide to enter into the residential power and gas market, ED could provide site registration and gas/power price risk management services to sit behind the Wessex brand.  Given that Wessex is Enron's biggest retail platform in Europe, have you given any thought as to how it could be closer integrated with Enron Direct generally?  Given current market conditions, I expect Enron will have little choice but to hold onto Wessex for the time being which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  There could obviously be some regulatory issues in bringing our retail water and energy businesses together, though I think it is worth looking at.  ED has 150,000 I&C customers across the UK, making it a good fit for Wessex.  Also, if the Water market opens up to competition in the future, there would be benefits for Wessex.

Please no= te=20 that underlying the entire selection process is the fact that MLP units are=  a=20 specialized product sold to a more limited group of investors vis-.-vis=20 common stock.  Thus, sheer underwriting bulk or equity league table positio= n=20 of a given firm does not necessarily indicate the expected performance of= =20 such firm in an NBP offering.=20  Lead Manager - Salomon Smith Barney SSB controls an impressive retail distribution system that has a strong=20 appetite of MLP offerings.  The visibility of NBP within their system has= =20 increased recently as their MLP analyst has raised his rating on NBP to=20 ""Outperform"".  SSB has served as a co-manager in past NBP offerings and has= =20 performed well.  Furthermore, due to their comparatively small allocations = in=20 these deals as a co-manager, we are confident that their system has=20 significant untapped demand for NBP units.  Joint Lead Manager - UBS Warburg (f/k/a PaineWebber) UBS has served a lead manager for the last two NBP offerings that were=20 conducted via the rapid placement (limited marketing) process, so they are= =20 very familiar with NBP and provide very good analyst coverage.  While we ar= e=20 still confident that UBS will perform well and place a large number of unit= s,=20 their allocations as lead manager in our past deals probably soaked up a=20 great deal of demand for NBP units within their system.  Therefore, rather= =20 than placing UBS in a situation where they would have to stretch to put awa= y=20 a lead manager allocation, it was deemed prudent to slot them in the joint= =20 lead role.  Co-Managers Dain Rauscher and A.G. Edwards Both firms have a strong mid-market presence and have demonstrated their=20 ability to place a significant number of NBP units in past offerings.  Thes= e=20 firms have not participated in an NBP deal since 1997, so this offering=20 should generate strong demand.  Also, Dain Rauscher was recently acquired b= y=20 Royal Bank of Canada, which provides commercial bank lending to NBP and NBP= L,=20 so NBP will be able to leverage DR=01,s participation in future debt=20 transactions.  Bank of America and First Union Bank of America has been a significant provider of commercial banking=20 services to NBP and NBPL over many years, while First Union recently became= =20 an NBP lender in the March 2001 transaction.  Both have retail distribution= =20 systems available which currently hold a limited number of NBP units.  Both= =20 have participated in past MLP offerings, with Bank of America serving as a= =20 joint lead for highly successful Williams MLP IPO.  Other institutions considered but not selected Goldman Sachs & Lehman Brothers - Both firms support the MLP product=20 reasonably well and have demonstrated adequate coverage of NBP.  Their=20 systems are geared towards institutional sales and high net-worth clients, = so=20 their breadth of distribution for MLP units is more limited as compared to= =20 SSB or UBS.

In fact a portfolio of  assets would likely reduce the companies overall risk to crude prices.   Second, we want to avoid any additional exposure to commodity prices.   Therefore, fee based business structures are the best fit.  That would  include pipeline acquisitions (crude, liquid, natural gas, CO2, etc) as well  as fee based processing.  Non-qualified income based aquisitions are also ok  as long as they are fee based-type deals 9IE..electric generation).   Terminals are also an excellent acquistion for MLP,s.

Our attorneys commented that  the legal fees to accomplish that (when we have a public offering going on)  may ""chew up"" the benefits.  But that is their normal reaction - I don't  think there will be any problem in accomplishing the placement.  Most likely  it will need to be priced simultaneously with the offering to avoid any  perceived ""insider"" pricing benefit.  But - do you think that will cause  problems internally on the DASH?  The GP contribution will be about $2.5  million.  My concern is RAC will require the $2.5 million GP investment to be  combined with the $2 million in LP units, which I believe will trigger  Skilling's sign-off.  On the FAS 125 idea, we have a structure that has been proposed by SunTrust  that I need to review with you and someone in EGF.

With regard to EOTT, we plan to keep the same  attention and focus on all of the EOTT initiaitives.  I'm a little bit  surprised by your comment that they didn't know because I talked with Dana  the day after I announced it at Phil's staff meeting.  Obviously something  broke down somewhere and I need to keep that in mind in the future.    Relative to your second concern, I'd be less than honest with you if I told  you that I don't have the same concern.  Phil and I discussed this at some  length but since his work on the international side was winding down and  Hawkins really didn't have anything for him going forward we thought his  measurement background and technical knowledge might be a fit here.  Don and  I talked to Lohit at some length about the communications and relationship  building required for him to be successful in the job and he felt he could  handle it.  I plan to stay on top of it.  If I see the communications and/or  relationships that are required for this job breaking down, I plan to deal  with them quickly through the performance mangement process.

We are starting on your drafting work now that we have received the engagement letter.  We have a few questions that need answering, as follows:  1. I need David to send me materials on Morgan Stanley Trust Co. so that we can properly designate the right entity by correct name, etc.  If they have any suggested or required language for our documents, I need to see that as well.  Finally, I need for David to confirm with Morgan Stanley's fiduciary people whether Morgan Stanley can serve as a co-agent under a Statutory Durable Power of Attorney and whether there are any constraints or limitations in doing so that would impact our drafting. David can follow-up directly with me if that suits you.  2. I want to remind you to send me a photocopy of Caron's ""old"" trust document, so that we may consider whether it fits the current plan and can serve as a receptacle under the current plan.   Sending it out today  3. We talked about setting up Debbie and MSDW as co-executor and co-trustees under your Will, with Caron as back-up to Debbie in that position.  However, we are also going to create a generation-skipping trust right away for Caron.  Who should be the initial trustee(s) of Caron's trust?  Debbie and MSDW?  or Randy and MSDW?  or even Caron and MSDW?   and who shoud be back-up?   Caron and MSDW   4. You said that Debbie wants to name you as executor and trustee under her will.  Who should be your back-up in those roles?  If Linda Wehring is Debbie's back-up on Debbie's power of attorney, I would suggest that she also be the back-up executor/trustee, but Debbie may prefer to name Caron. It would be best if Debbie would name at least two successors after you.  1.  Caron  2.  Linda Wehring (alternate)   That's it.  Please respond by whatever mode you prefer.  I hope email is reasonably satisfactory for purposes of my asking these questions. I tend to start with email because it is so non-obtrusive, but I'm happy to do whatever you prefer.
